# Something-In-Memory

This will be a project that I work on every so often that will be made in whatever languages I add to it. Updates will be very infrequent and releases will or will not happen depending on what I decide this project is.
Something In Memory is simply that something that will linger in my memory and be modified when I get the urge to give it a new update. I am trying something ive never done or even considered so do be patient while i try to force Jank Gseppo Code to work over three languages. Thank you and please: do Keep this as __Something In__ (your) __Memory__
